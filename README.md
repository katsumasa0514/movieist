# DEMO
 
You can learn how to making cute physics simulations (looks retro game).

This animation is a "Cat playing on trampoline"!
You can get basic skills for making physics simulations.
 
# Features
 
Physics_Sim_Py used [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) only.
 
```python
import pyxel
```
[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) is a retro game engine for Python.
You can feel free to enjoy making pixel art style physics simulations.
 
# Requirement
 
* Python 3.6.5
* pyxel 1.0.2
 
Environments under [Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is tested.
 
```bash
conda create -n pyxel pip python=3.6 Anaconda
activate pyxel
```
 
# Installation
 
Install Pyxel with pip command.
 
```bash
pip install pyxel
```
 
# Usage
 
Please create python code named "demo.py".
And copy &amp; paste [Day4 tutorial code](https://cpp-learning.com/pyxel_physical_sim4/).
 
Run "demo.py"
 
```bash
python demo.py
```
 
# Note
 
I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.
